# Home_Security_Cam_ML_Face_Rec
Developed a smart security camera using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV and AWS S3 Bucket for our MIS Information Technology Projects course at San Diego State University.

In this project, we developed our knowledge using Raspberry Pi, coding in  Python, deep diving into Machine Learning with OpenCV facial recognition algorithms, and utilizing AWS S3 Bucket for data storage.


WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO RUN THIS CODE:
 - AWS Account
 - Need to create a bucket, and save the new secret keys and save in SECRETS.py in order to allow permissions of sending data into bucket...
 - Create new event notification... 
 - install AWS boto3 sdk from AWS site... 
 - install Haraascascades (face recognition algorithm)... 
 - install open cv and opencv contrib...
 
 Please keep in mind, the scripts in my repo are just the source code for face recognition and connecting to Raspberry Pi cam and AWS. I did not add files that obtain my personal information.
 
 
 Thanks for understanding,
